This doc tracks snippets of coffee as examples of how to exercise the quant module.

One of the overlooked features of coffee-script/nodeJS env is dynamic nature of runtime repl enironment.
Much like you can login to your favorite shell and condition the env by executing commands developers can leverage the REPL.

# pull in aliases and helper funcs most notably roast and rcb callback
require 'chno'

# reload the quant module (env must have require and JSONPath available)
q = r.reinjectMod 'quant'
gfin = q.gfin

# request front month option chain for our friends at the GOOG
gfin.front 'goog',rcb

# request the entire term structure of options
gfin.chains 'goog',rcb

# request third month out option chain
gfin.expirations 'goog',rcb
# wait for result
exps = result
gfin.chain 'goog',exps[3],rcb

# request past year worth of daily data
gfin.daily 'goog',gfin.past_year(),rcb
